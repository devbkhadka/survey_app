- Implement feature to post form when next button clicked
- implement contextmanager for wait to be used in functional test
- use token instead of response_id in cookie to make it secure
- rename get_question_and_index_of_type to match its return tuple

Rejected
- Refactor take_survey url to have <survey_id>/<question_id>
  Because it would be easier to implement question order
